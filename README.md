# ML_PIPELINE# SAGE: Smart Analytics and Guidance Engine

SAGE is an interactive Streamlit-based application designed to simplify machine learning tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploratory data analysis (EDA), automatic machine learning (AutoML), and clustering tasks. The tool leverages libraries such as `TPOT`, `ydata-profiling`, and `scikit-learn` to automate the creation of optimized pipelines.

## Features

1. **Dataset Upload**:
   - Upload CSV datasets directly to the app.
   - Automatic storage of the uploaded dataset for future use.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate comprehensive profiling reports using `ydata-profiling`.
   - Visualize and understand the structure of your data.

3. **Machine Learning Tasks**:
   - **Regression**: Automates the generation of regression models with `TPOTRegressor`.
   - **Classification**: Creates classification models with `TPOTClassifier`.
   - **Clustering**: Implements KMeans clustering with metrics like silhouette score.

4. **Downloadable Pipelines**:
   - Download the best pipeline generated by TPOT for regression or classification tasks.

5. **Interactive Interface**:
   - Simple navigation through multiple stages: Upload Dataset, Perform EDA, Select Task, Get ML Pipeline, and View Results.

## Usage

1. Launch the application in your browser by running the Streamlit command.
2. Navigate through the following stages:
   - **Upload Dataset**: Upload your CSV dataset.
   - **Perform EDA**: Generate a profiling report for your data.
   - **Select Task**: Choose between Regression, Classification, or Clustering.
   - **Get ML Pipeline**: Automatically generate and optimize a pipeline for your selected task.
   - **Results**: View the best pipeline and download it as a Python file.
